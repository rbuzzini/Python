    "\r\n",
    "To write effective computer programs, and to build a good conceptual model of program execution, a programmer needs to develop the ability to **trace** the execution of a computer program. Tracing involves becoming the computer and following the flow of execution through a sample program run, recording the state of all variables and any output the program generates after each instruction is executed.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To understand this process, let’s trace the call to <font color=red>seq3np1(3)</font> from the previous section. At the start of the trace, we have a variable, n (the parameter), with an initial value of 3. Since 3 is not equal to 1, the while loop body is executed. 3 is printed and 3 % 2 == 0 is evaluated. Since it evaluates to False, the else branch is executed and 3 * 3 + 1 is evaluated and assigned to n.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To keep track of all this as you hand trace a program, make a column heading on a piece of paper for each variable created as the program runs and another one for output.\r\n",

    "Tracing can be a bit tedious and error prone (that’s why we get computers to do this stuff in the first place!), but it is an essential skill for a programmer to have. From this trace we can learn a lot about the way our code works. We can observe that as soon as <font color=red>n</font> becomes a power of <font color=red>2</font>, for example, the program will require <font color=red>log2(n)</font> executions of the loop body to complete. We can also see that the final <font color=red>1</font> will not be printed as output within the body of the loop, which is why we put the special <font color=red>print</font> function at the end.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Tracing a program is, of course, related to single-stepping through your code and being able to inspect the variables. Using the computer to **single-step** for you is less error prone and more convenient. Also, as your programs get more complex, they might execute many millions of steps before they get to the code that you’re really interested in, so manual tracing becomes impossible. Being able to set a **breakpoint** where you need one is far more powerful. So we strongly encourage you to invest time in learning using to use your programming environment to full effect.\r\n",

This chunking allowed us to put aside the details of the particular game — is it a card game, or noughts and crosses, or a role playing game — and simply focus on one isolated part of our program logic — letting the player choose whether they want to play again.\r\n",

    "Understanding that hard problems can be solved by step-by-step algorithmic processes (and having technology to execute these algorithms for us) is one of the major breakthroughs that has had enormous benefits. So while the execution of the algorithm may be boring and may require no intelligence, algorithmic or computational thinking — i.e. using algorithms and automation as the basis for approaching problems — is rapidly transforming our society. Some claim that this shift towards algorithmic thinking and processes is going to have even more impact on our society than the invention of the printing press. And the process of designing algorithms is interesting, intellectually challenging, and a central part of what we call programming.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty or conscious thought, are the hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural language is a good example. We all do it, but so far no one has been able to explain how we do it, at least not in the form of a step-by-step mechanical algorithm."
