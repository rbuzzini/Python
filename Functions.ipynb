    "Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Statements are executed one at a time, in order from top to bottom.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the function are not executed until the function is called. Although it is not common, we can define one function inside another. In this case, the inner definition isn’t executed until the outer function is called.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Function calls are like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the first line of the called function, executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.\r\n",

    "That sounds simple enough, until we remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to execute the statements in another function. But while executing that new function, the program might have to execute yet another function!\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "This is a powerful mechanism for building a deep and thorough understanding of what is happening at each step of the way. Learn to use the single-stepping feature well, and be mentally proactive: as you work through the code, challenge yourself before each step: “What changes will this line make to any variables in the program?” and “Where will flow of execution go next?”"

    "A statement that executes a function. It consists of the name of the function followed by a list of arguments enclosed in parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### function composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the output from one function call as the input to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### function definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A statement that creates a new function, specifying its name, parameters, and the statements it executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### fruitful function\n",
    "\n",
    "A function that returns a value when it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### header line\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of a compound statement. A header line begins with a keyword and ends with a colon (:)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### import statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A statement which permits functions and variables defined in another Python module to be brought into the environment of another script. To use the features of the turtle, we need to first import the turtle module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### lifetime\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables and objects have lifetimes — they are created at some point during program execution, and will be destroyed at some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### local variable\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable defined inside a function. A local variable can only be used inside its function. Parameters of a function are also a special kind of local variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "A name used inside a function to refer to the value which was passed to it as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### refactor\n",
    "\n",
    "A fancy word to describe reorganizing our program code, usually to make it more understandable. Typically, we have a program that is already working, then we go back to “tidy it up”. It often involves choosing better variable names, or spotting repeated patterns and moving that code into a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### stack diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "A graphical representation of a stack of functions, their variables, and the values to which they refer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### traceback\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of the functions that are executing, printed when a runtime error occurs. A traceback is also commonly referred to as a stack trace, since it lists the functions in the order in which they are stored in the runtime stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### void function\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite of a fruitful function: one that does not return a value. It is executed for the work it does, rather than for the value it returns."
